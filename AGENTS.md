# Agent Instructions

- Use a single tab character for each level of indentation in all Godot script files (.gd). Do not use spaces to indent.
- Always properly indent the bodies of `func`, `if`, `elif`, `else`, `for`, `while`, and `match` blocks. Code within these blocks must be indented one level deeper than the line starting the block.
- Do not leave code unindented after a colon (`:`); any statement that follows a control structure or function definition must be indented.
- When generating multi-line code, ensure all nested blocks are consistently indented using tabs.
