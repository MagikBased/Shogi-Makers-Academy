# Agent Instructions

- Use a single tab character for each level of indentation in all Godot script files (.gd). Do not use spaces to indent.
- If spaces slip in, convert them back to tabs with:
- `sed -i 's/^\s\+/\t/' path/to/file.gd`
- Preserve all existing function declarations in Godot scripts. Do not remove or rename them unless a task explicitly states otherwise.
- Keep conditional statements on a single line and avoid using `\` for line continuations.
